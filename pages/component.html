				'A resistor is passive two-terminal electrical component that implements electrical resistance as a circuit element. In electronic circuits, they are used to reduce current flow, adjust signal levels, to divide voltages, bias active elements, and terminate transmission lines, among other uses. Resistors that can dissipate many watts of electrical power, used as part of motor controls, in power distribution, or test loads for generators.

				'A capacitor is a device that stores electrical energy in an electric field. It is a passive electronic component with two terminals.The effect of a capacitor is known as capacitance. While some capacitance exists between any two electrical conductors in proximity in a circuit, a capacitor is a component designed to add capacitance to a circuit. It also known as condenser microphones, also called capacitor microphones.

				'An inductor is a passive two-terminal electrical component that stores energy in a magnetic field when electric current flows through it. An inductor typically consists of an insulated wire wound into a coil around a core. According to Lenzs law, the induced voltage has a polarity which opposes the change in current that created it. Thus, inductors oppose any changes in current through them.
